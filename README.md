# Fraud Detection Project

### Mini abstract

I present this project with some ideas about how to deal with unbalanced data, use metrics different than the typical accuracy measure and explore the use of trees, a lot of trees, CART, random forest and XGBoost with balance and unbalanced data. All of this to get a good prediction for a very small quantity of fraud cases. 

Note: All of this using R.

### Dataset

The dataset used is on [./data/creditCard.zip](https://github.com/AgustinGallo/fraudDetection/tree/main/data).

The code provided on the .R file will unzip and prepare the data. 

In case of any problems you can download it from [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
